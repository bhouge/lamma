# lamma
real-time audio parameterization demo

A port of the parameterizeable water behavior from my Landscape with Water and Woodblocks sound installation (2012).
The original water source is a field recording I made of a stream on Lamma Island in Hong Kong, sometime around July 2012.

After you clone, type 'npm install' to install the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

type 'node water.js' to start the server

in one browser window, go to http://localhost:8300
in another, go to http://localhost:8300/Controller

press the 'on' button to start the water flowing

adjust sliders to change sound as desired.

TODO: 
add another set of sliders to map these parameters onto stream size and speed.
use canvas to visualize grains of water flowing past
